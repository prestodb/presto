Statement Resource
==================

.. function:: POST /v1/statement

   :query query: SQL Query to execute
   :reqheader X-Presto-User: User to execute statement on behalf of (optional)
   :reqheader X-Presto-Source: Source of query
   :reqheader X-Presto-Catalog: Catalog to execute query against
   :reqheader X-Presto-Schema: Schema to execute query against

   Submits a statement to Presto for execution. The Presto client
   executes queries on behalf of a user against a catalog and a
   schema. When you run a query with the Presto CLI, it is calling
   out to the statement resource on the Presto coordinator.

   The request to the statement resource is the SQL query to execute as
   a post along with the standard X-Presto-Catalog, X-Presto-Source,
   X-Presto-Schema, and X-Presto-User headers.

   The response from the statement resource contains a query
   identifier which can be used to gather detailed information about a
   query. This initial response also includes information about the
   stages that have been created to execute this query on Presto
   workers. Every query has a root stage and the root stage is given a
   stage identifier of "0" as shown in the following example response.

   This root stage aggregates the responses from other stages running
   on Presto workers and delivers them to the client via the Presto
   coordinator. When a client receives a response to this POST it will
   contain a "nextUri" property which directs the client to query this
   address for additional results from the query.

.. function:: PUT /v1/statement/{queryId}?slug={slug}

   :query query: SQL Query to execute
   :query queryId: Query identifier to associate with this query
   :query slug: Nonce to associate with this query, that will be required for subsequent requests
   :reqheader X-Presto-User: User to execute statement on behalf of (optional)
   :reqheader X-Presto-Source: Source of query
   :reqheader X-Presto-Catalog: Catalog to execute query against
   :reqheader X-Presto-Schema: Schema to execute query against

   Submits a statement to Presto for execution. This function is
   the analogue of the POST, and behaves exactly the same. The
   difference is that a query id and slug can be explicitly provided,
   instead of Presto generating it.

.. function:: GET /v1/statement/{queryId}/{token}

   :query queryId: The query identifier returned from the initial POST to /v1/statement
   :query token: The token returned from the initial POST to /v1/statement or from a previous call to this same call

   When a Presto client submits a statement for execution, Presto
   creates a query and then it returns a nextUri to the client. This
   call corresponds to that nextUri call and can contain either a
   status update for a query in progress or it can deliver the final
   results to the client.

   **Example request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      GET /v1/statement/20140108_110629_00011_dk5x2/1 HTTP/1.1
