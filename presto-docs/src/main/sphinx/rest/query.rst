Query Resource
==============

The Query REST service is the most complex of the rest services. It
contains detailed information about nodes, and other
details that capture the state and history of a query being executed
on a Presto installation.

.. function:: GET /v1/query

   This service returns information and statistics about queries that
   are currently being executed on a Presto coordinator.

   When you point a web browser at a Presto coordinate you'll see a
   rendered version of the output from this service which will display
   recent queries that have executed on a Presto installation.

.. function:: GET /v1/query/{queryId}

   If you are looking to gather very detailed statistics about a
   query, this is the service you would call. If you load the web
   interface of a Presto coordinator you will see a list of current
   queries. Clicking on a query will reveal a link to this service.

   **Example response**:
