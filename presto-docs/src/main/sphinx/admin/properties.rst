General Properties
------------------

``distributed-joins-enabled``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``boolean``
    * **Default value:** ``true``

    Use hash distributed joins instead of broadcast joins. Distributed joins
    require redistributing both tables using a hash of the join key. This can
    be slower (sometimes substantially) than broadcast joins, but allows much
    larger joins. Broadcast joins require that the tables on the right side of
    the join after filtering fit in memory on each node, whereas distributed joins
    only need to fit in distributed memory across all nodes. This can also be
    specified on a per-query basis using the ``distributed_join`` session property.

``redistribute-writes``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``boolean``
    * **Default value:** ``true``

    This property enables redistribution of data before writing. This can
    eliminate the performance impact of data skew when writing by hashing it
    across nodes in the cluster. It can be disabled when it is known that the
    output data set is not skewed in order to avoid the overhead of hashing and
    redistributing all the data across the network. This can also be specified
    on a per-query basis using the ``redistribute_writes`` session property.

``resources.reserved-system-memory``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``data size``
    * **Default value:** ``JVM max memory * 0.4``

    The amount of JVM memory reserved, for accounting purposes, for things
    that are not directly attributable to or controllable by a user query.
    For example, output buffers, code caches, etc. This also accounts for
    memory that is not tracked by the memory tracking system.

    The purpose of this property is to prevent the JVM from running out of
    memory (OOM). The default value is suitable for smaller JVM heap sizes or
    clusters with many concurrent queries. If running fewer queries with a
    large heap, a smaller value may work. Basically, set this value large
    enough that the JVM does not fail with ``OutOfMemoryError``.


Exchange Properties
-------------------

Exchanges transfer data between Presto nodes for different stages of
a query. Adjusting these properties may help to resolve inter-node
communication issues or improve network utilization.

``exchange.client-threads``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``integer``
    * **Minimum value:** ``1``
    * **Default value:** ``25``

    Number of threads used by exchange clients to fetch data from other Presto
    nodes. A higher value can improve performance for large clusters or clusters
    with very high concurrency, but excessively high values may cause a drop
    in performance due to context switches and additional memory usage.

``exchange.concurrent-request-multiplier``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``integer``
    * **Minimum value:** ``1``
    * **Default value:** ``3``

    Multiplier determining the number of concurrent requests relative to
    available buffer memory. The maximum number of requests is determined
    using a heuristic of the number of clients that can fit into available
    buffer space based on average buffer usage per request times this
    multiplier. For example, with an ``exchange.max-buffer-size`` of ``32 MB``
    and ``20 MB`` already used and average size per request being ``2MB``,
    the maximum number of clients is
    ``multiplier * ((32MB - 20MB) / 2MB) = multiplier * 6``. Tuning this
    value adjusts the heuristic, which may increase concurrency and improve
    network utilization.

``exchange.max-buffer-size``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``data size``
    * **Default value:** ``32 MB``

    Size of buffer in the exchange client that holds data fetched from other
    nodes before it is processed. A larger buffer can increase network
    throughput for larger clusters and thus decrease query processing time,
    but will reduce the amount of memory available for other usages.

``exchange.max-response-size``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``data size``
    * **Minimum value:** ``1MB``
    * **Default value:** ``16 MB``

    Maximum size of a response returned from an exchange request. The response
    will be placed in the exchange client buffer which is shared across all
    concurrent requests for the exchange.

    Increasing the value may improve network throughput if there is high
    latency. Decreasing the value may improve query performance for large
    clusters as it reduces skew due to the exchange client buffer holding
    responses for more tasks (rather than hold more data from fewer tasks).

``sink.max-buffer-size``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``data size``
    * **Default value:** ``32 MB``

    Output buffer size for task data that is waiting to be pulled by upstream
    tasks. If the task output is hash partitioned, then the buffer will be
    shared across all of the partitioned consumers. Increasing this value may
    improve network throughput for data transferred between stages if the
    network has high latency or if there are many nodes in the cluster.


Tasks managment properties
--------------------------

``task.max-worker-threads``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``integer``
    * **Default value:** ``Node CPUs * 2``

    Sets the number of threads used by workers to process splits. Increasing this number
    can improve throughput if worker CPU utilization is low and all the threads are in use,
    but will cause increased heap space usage. Setting the value too high may cause a drop
    in performance due to a context switching. The number of active threads is available
    via the ``com.facebook.presto.execution.executor.TaskExecutor.RunningSplits`` JMX stat.


Node Scheduler Properties
-------------------------

``node-scheduler.max-splits-per-node``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``integer``
    * **Default value:** ``100``

    The target value for the total number of splits that can be running for
    each worker node.

    Using a higher value is recommended if queries are submitted in large batches
    (e.g., running a large group of reports periodically) or for connectors that
    produce many splits that complete quickly. Increasing this value may improve
    query latency by ensuring that the workers have enough splits to keep them
    fully utilized.

    Setting this too high will waste memory and may result in lower performance
    due to splits not being balanced across workers. Ideally, it should be set
    such that there is always at least one split waiting to be processed, but
    not higher.

``node-scheduler.max-pending-splits-per-task``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``integer``
    * **Default value:** ``10``

    The number of outstanding splits that can be queued for each worker node
    for a single stage of a query, even when the node is already at the limit for
    total number of splits. Allowing a minimum number of splits per stage is
    required to prevent starvation and deadlocks.

    This value must be smaller than ``node-scheduler.max-splits-per-node``,
    will usually be increased for the same reasons, and has similar drawbacks
    if set too high.

``node-scheduler.min-candidates``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``integer``
    * **Minimum value:** ``1``
    * **Default value:** ``10``

    The minimum number of candidate nodes that will be evaluated by the
    node scheduler when choosing the target node for a split. Setting
    this value too low may prevent splits from being properly balanced
    across all worker nodes. Setting it too high may increase query
    latency and increase CPU usage on the coordinator.

``node-scheduler.network-topology``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``string``
    * **Allowed values:** ``legacy``, ``flat``
    * **Default value:** ``legacy``


Optimizer Properties
--------------------

``optimizer.dictionary-aggregation``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``boolean``
    * **Default value:** ``false``

    Enables optimization for aggregations on dictionaries. This can also be specified
    on a per-query basis using the ``dictionary_aggregation`` session property.

``optimizer.optimize-hash-generation``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``boolean``
    * **Default value:** ``true``

    Compute hash codes for distribution, joins, and aggregations early during execution,
    allowing result to be shared between operations later in the query. This can reduce
    CPU usage by avoiding computing the same hash multiple times, but at the cost of
    additional network transfer for the hashes. In most cases it will decrease overall
    query processing time. This can also be specified on a per-query basis using the
    ``optimize_hash_generation`` session property.

    It is often helpful to disable this property when using :doc:`/sql/explain` in order
    to make the query plan easier to read.

``optimizer.optimize-metadata-queries``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``boolean``
    * **Default value:** ``false``

    Enable optimization of some aggregations by using values that are stored as metadata.
    This allows Presto to execute some simple queries in constant time. Currently, this
    optimization applies to ``max``, ``min`` and ``approx_distinct`` of partition
    keys and other aggregation insensitive to the cardinality of the input (including
    ``DISTINCT`` aggregates). Using this may speed up some queries significantly.

    The main drawback is that it can produce incorrect results if the connector returns
    partition keys for partitions that have no rows. In particular, the Hive connector
    can return empty partitions if they were created by other systems (Presto cannot
    create them).

``optimizer.optimize-single-distinct``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``boolean``
    * **Default value:** ``true``

    The single distinct optimization will try to replace multiple ``DISTINCT`` clauses
    with a single ``GROUP BY`` clause, which can be substantially faster to execute.

``optimizer.push-table-write-through-union``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * **Type:** ``boolean``
    * **Default value:** ``true``

    Parallelize writes when using ``UNION ALL`` in queries that write data. This improves the
    speed of writing output tables in ``UNION ALL`` queries because these writes do not require
    additional synchronization when collecting results. Enabling this optimization can improve
    ``UNION ALL`` speed when write speed is not yet saturated. However, it may slow down queries
    in an already heavily loaded system. This can also be specified on a per-query basis
    using the ``push_table_write_through_union`` session property.
