=====================
System Access Control
=====================

Presto separates the concept of the principal who authenticates to the
coordinator from the username that is responsible for running queries. When
running the Presto CLI, for example, the Presto username can be specified using
the ``--user`` option.

By default, the Presto coordinator allows any principal to run queries as any
Presto user. In a secure environment, this is probably not desirable behavior
and likely requires customization.

Implementation
--------------

``SystemAccessControlFactory`` is responsible for creating a
``SystemAccessControl`` instance. It also defines a ``SystemAccessControl``
name which is used by the administrator in a Presto configuration.

``SystemAccessControl`` implementations have several responsibilities:

* Verifying whether or not a given principal is authorized to execute queries as a specific user.
* Determining whether or not a given user can alter values for a given system property.
* Performing access checks across all catalogs. These access checks happen before
  any connector specific checks and thus can deny permissions that would otherwise
  be allowed by ``ConnectorAccessControl``.

The implementation of ``SystemAccessControl`` and ``SystemAccessControlFactory``
must be wrapped as a plugin and installed on the Presto cluster.

Row Filters and Column Masks
----------------------------

The access control implementation can optionally provide row filters and column masks to
control viewing of specific rows or mask sensitive values in columns. The filters
and masks are retrieved per table from the given ``Identity``, schema, table, and
column names. The returned filters and masks will be in the form of a ``ViewExpression``
that is then applied to the query plan before execution. Filters and masks can also be
supplied at the connector level from a ``ConnectorAccessControl`` implementation.

Configuration
-------------

After a plugin that implements ``SystemAccessControl`` and
``SystemAccessControlFactory`` has been installed on the coordinator, it is
configured using an ``etc/access-control.properties`` file. All of the properties
other than ``access-control.name`` are specific to the ``SystemAccessControl``
implementation.

The ``access-control.name`` property is used by Presto to find a registered
``SystemAccessControlFactory`` based on the name returned by
``SystemAccessControlFactory.getName()``. The remaining properties are passed
as a map to ``SystemAccessControlFactory.create()``.

Example configuration file:

.. code-block:: none

    access-control.name=custom-access-control
    custom-property1=custom-value1
    custom-property2=custom-value2
