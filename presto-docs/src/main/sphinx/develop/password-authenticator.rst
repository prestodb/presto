======================
Password Authenticator
======================

Presto supports authentication with a username and password via a custom
password authenticator that validates the credentials and creates a principal.

Implementation
--------------

``PasswordAuthenticatorFactory`` is responsible for creating a
``PasswordAuthenticator`` instance. It also defines the name of this
authenticator which is used by the administrator in a Presto configuration.

``PasswordAuthenticator`` contains a single method, ``createAuthenticatedPrincipal()``,
that validates the credential and returns a ``Principal``, which is then
authorized by the :doc:`system-access-control`.

The implementation of ``PasswordAuthenticatorFactory`` must be wrapped
as a plugin and installed on the Presto cluster.

Configuration
-------------

After a plugin that implements ``PasswordAuthenticatorFactory`` has been
installed on the coordinator, it is configured using an
``etc/password-authenticator.properties`` file. All of the
properties other than ``password-authenticator.name`` are specific to the
``PasswordAuthenticatorFactory`` implementation.

The ``password-authenticator.name`` property is used by Presto to find a
registered ``PasswordAuthenticatorFactory`` based on the name returned by
``PasswordAuthenticatorFactory.getName()``. The remaining properties are
passed as a map to ``PasswordAuthenticatorFactory.create()``.

Example configuration file:

.. code-block:: none

    password-authenticator.name=custom-password-authenticator
    custom-property1=custom-value1
    custom-property2=custom-value2

Additionally, the coordinator must be configured to use password authentication
and have HTTPS enabled.

Add the property shown below to the coordinator's ``config.properties`` file :

.. code-block:: none

   http-server.authentication.type=PASSWORD
