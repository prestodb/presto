REVOKE ROLES
============

Synopsis
--------

.. code-block:: none

    REVOKE
    [ ADMIN OPTION FOR ]
    role [, ...] [,]
    FROM ( user | USER user | ROLE role) [, ...] [,]
    [ GRANTED BY ( user | USER user | ROLE role | CURRENT_USER | CURRENT_ROLE ) ]

Description
-----------

Revokes the specified role(s) from the specified principal(s) in the current catalog.

If the ``ADMIN OPTION FOR`` clause is specified, the ``GRANT`` permission is
revoked instead of the role.

For the ``REVOKE`` statement for roles to succeed, the user executing it either should
be the role admin or should possess the ``GRANT`` option for the given role.

The optional ``GRANTED BY`` clause causes the role(s) to be revoked with
the specified principal as a revoker. If the ``GRANTED BY`` clause is not
specified, the roles are revoked by the current user as a revoker.

Examples
--------

Revoke role ``bar`` from user ``foo`` ::

    REVOKE bar FROM USER foo;

Revoke admin option for roles ``bar`` and ``foo`` from user ``baz`` and role ``qux`` ::

    REVOKE ADMIN OPTION FOR bar, foo FROM USER baz, ROLE qux;

Limitations
-----------

Some connectors do not support role management.
See connector documentation for more details.
