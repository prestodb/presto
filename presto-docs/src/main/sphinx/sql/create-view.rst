CREATE VIEW
===========

Synopsis
--------

.. code-block:: none

    CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] VIEW view_name
    [ SECURITY { DEFINER | INVOKER } ]
    AS query

Description
-----------

Create a new view of a :doc:`select` query. The view is a logical table
that can be referenced by future queries. Views do not contain any data.
Instead, the query stored by the view is executed every time the view is
referenced by another query.

The optional ``OR REPLACE`` clause causes the view to be replaced if it
already exists rather than raising an error.

Security
--------

In the default ``DEFINER`` security mode, tables referenced in the view
are accessed using the permissions of the view owner (the *creator* or
*definer* of the view) rather than the user executing the query. This
allows providing restricted access to the underlying tables, for which
the query user may not be allowed to access directly. Note that the
``current_user`` function will return the query user, not the view owner,
and thus may be used to filter out rows or otherwise restrict access
based on the user currently accessing the view.

In the ``INVOKER`` security mode, tables referenced in the view are
accessed using the permissions of the query user (the *invoker* of the
view). A view created in this mode is simply a stored query.

Examples
--------

Create a simple view ``test`` over the ``orders`` table::

    CREATE VIEW test AS
    SELECT orderkey, orderstatus, totalprice / 2 AS half
    FROM orders

Create a view ``orders_by_date`` that summarizes ``orders``::

    CREATE VIEW orders_by_date AS
    SELECT orderdate, sum(totalprice) AS price
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY orderdate

Create a view that replaces an existing view::

    CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW test AS
    SELECT orderkey, orderstatus, totalprice / 4 AS quarter
    FROM orders
