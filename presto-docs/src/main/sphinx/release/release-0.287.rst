General Changes
_______________
* Fix a bug in CTE reference node creation, where different CTEs may be incorrectly considered as the same CTE. :pr:`22515`
* Fix an issue with heuristic CTE materialization strategy where incorrect CTEs were materialized. :pr:`22433`
* Fix plan canonicalization by canonicalizing plan node ids. :pr:`22033`
* Fix bug with spilling in TopNRowNumber. :pr:`22281`
* Fix problem when writing large varchar values to throw a user error when it exceeds internal limits. :pr:`22063`
* Fix queries that filter with ``LIKE '%...%'`` over char columns. :pr:`22076`
* Fix the regr_count, regr_avgx, regr_avgy, regr_syy, regr_sxx, and regr_sxy functions result to be null when the input data is null, not 0. :pr:`22112`
* Fix precision loss when timestamp yielded from ``from_unixtime(double)`` function. :pr:`21899`
* Fix CAST(str as INTEGER), CAST(str as BIGINT), CAST(str as SMALLINT), CAST(str as TINYINT) to allow leading and trailing spaces in the string. :pr:`22284`
* Improve latency of materialized CTEs by scheduling multiple dependent subgraphs independently. :pr:`22205`
* Improve propagation of logical properties by enabling it by default. :pr:`22266`
* Improve accuracy and performance of HyperLogLog functions. :pr:`21943`
* Improve repeat function to create RunLengthEncodedBlock to improve performance. :pr:`21984`
* Add Heuristic CTE Materialization strategy which auto materialized expensive CTEs. This is configurable by setting ``cte_materialization_strategy`` to ``HEURISTIC`` or ``HEURISTIC_COMPLEX_QUERIES_ONLY``. (default ``NONE``). :pr:`21720`
* Add a session property ``track_history_based_plan_statistics_from_complete_stages_in_failed_query`` to enable tracking hbo statistics from complete stages in failed queries. :pr:`20947`
* Add session property ``history_optimization_plan_canonicalize_strategy`` to specify the plan canonicalization strategies to use for HBO. :pr:`21832`
* Add worker type and query ID information in HBO stats. :pr:`22234`
* Add log of stats equivalent plan and canonicalized plan for HBO. This feature is controlled by session property ``log_query_plans_used_in_history_based_optimizer``. :pr:`22306`
* Add limit to the amount of data written during CTE Materialization. This is configurable by the session property ``query_max_written_intermediate_bytes`` (default is 2TB). :pr:`22017`
* Add a new plan canonicalization strategy ``ignore_scan_constants`` which canonicalizes predicates for both partitioned and non-partitioned columns in scan node. :pr:`21832`
* Add an optimizer rule to get rid of map cast in map access functions when possible. :pr:`22059`
* Add histogram column statistic to Presto for the optimizer. Connectors can now implement support for them. :pr:`21236`
* Add Quick stats, a mechanism to build stats from metadata for tables and partitions that are missing stats. :pr:`21436`
* Add DDL support for Table constraints (primary key and unique constraints). :pr:`20384`
* Add optimization for query plans which contain RowNumber and TopNRowNumber nodes with empty input. :pr:`21914`
* Add support for Apache DataSketches KLL sketch with the ``sketch_kll`` and related family of functions. :pr:`21568`
* Add support for ``map_key_exists`` builtin SQL UDF. :pr:`21966`
* Add configuration property ``legacy_json_cast`` whose default value is ``true``. See `Legacy Compatible Properties <../admin/properties.html#legacy-compatible-properties>`_. :pr:`21869`
* Add support for tracking of the input data size when there is a fragment result cache hit. This can be enabled by setting the configuration property ``fragment-result-cache.input-data-stats-enabled=true``. :pr:`22145`
* Add JSON as a supported output format in the Presto CLI. :pr:`22181`
* Add documentation for supported data `Type mapping <../connector/iceberg.html#type-mapping>`_  in the Iceberg connector. :pr:`22093`
* Add usage documentation for :doc:`/clients/presto-cli`. :pr:`22265`
* Add usage documentation for :doc:`/clients/presto-console`. :pr:`22349`
* Improve ``map_normalize`` builtin SQL UDF to avoid repeated reduce computation. :pr:`22211`
* Remove ``native_execution_enabled``, ``native_execution_executable_path`` and ``native_execution_program_arguments`` session properties. Corresponding configuration properties are still available. :pr:`22183`
* Remove the configuration property ``use-legacy-scheduler`` and the corresponding session property ``use_legacy_scheduler``.   The property previously defaulted to true, and the new scheduler, which was intended to replace it eventually, was never productionized and is no longer needed. The configuration property ``max-stage-retries`` and the session property ``max_stage_retries`` have also been removed. :pr:`21952`
* Upgrade Alluxio to 312. :pr:`22452`

Security Changes
________________
* Remove logback 1.2.3. :pr:`21819`
* Add session property ``default-view-security-mode`` to choose the default security mode for view creation. :pr:`21956`

Verifier Changes
________________
* Add support for extended bucket verification of INSERT and CTAS queries. This can be enabled by the configuration property ``extended-verification`` to verify each bucket's data checksum if the inserted table is bucketed. :pr:`22001`
* Add support for extended partition verification of INSERT and CTAS queries. This can be enabled by the configuration property ``extended-verification`` to verify each partition's data checksum if the inserted table is partitioned. :pr:`21983`

SPI Changes
___________
* Add replaceColumn method to com.facebook.common.Page. :pr:`22493`
* Remove SPI method ConnectorMetadata.getTableLayouts() as deprecated. Add ConnectorMetadata.getTableLayoutForConstraint() as replacement. :pr:`21933`
* Move `SortNode` to SPI module to be utilized in connector. :pr:`22497`

Hive Connector Changes
____________
* Fix a potential wrong results bug when footer stats are marked unreliable and partial aggregation pushdown is enabled.  Such queries will now fail with an error. :pr:`22011`
* Improve the ``hive.orc.use-column-names`` configuration setting to no longer fail on reading ORC files without column names, but fall back to using Hive's schema. This change improves compatibility with legacy ORC files. :pr:`21391`
* Add session property ``hive.dynamic_split_sizes_enabled`` to use dynamic split sizes based on data selected by query.  :pr:`22051`
* Add support for Filelist caching for symlink tables.  :pr:`19145`
* Add $row_id as a new hidden column. :pr:`22008`
* Add system procedure ``system.invalidate_directory_list_cache()`` to invalidate directory list cache in Hive Catalog. :pr:`19821`

Iceberg Connector Changes
_______________
* Upgrade Iceberg from 1.4.3 to 1.5.0. :pr:`21961`
* Fix identity and truncate transforms on DecimalType columns. :pr:`21958`
* Fix the bug that ``CAST`` from non-legacy timestamp to date rounding to future when the timestamp is prior than `1970-01-01 00:00:00.000`. :pr:`21959`
* Add support to set ``commit.retry.num-retries`` table property with table creation to make the number of attempts to make in case of concurrent upserts configurable. :pr:`21250`
* Add year/month/day/hour transforms both on legacy and non-legacy TimestampType column. :pr:`21959`
* Fix error encountered when attempting to execute an ``INSERT INTO`` statement where column names contain white spaces. :pr:`21827`
* Add support for row-level deletes on Iceberg V2 tables. The delete mode can be changed from ``merge-on-read`` to ``copy-on-write`` by setting table property ``delete_mode``. :pr:`21571`
* Add support for Iceberg V1 tables in Prestissimo. :pr:`22013`
* Add support to read Iceberg V2 tables with Position Deletes in Prestissimo. :pr:`21980`
* Add support for Iceberg concurrent insertions. :pr:`21250`
