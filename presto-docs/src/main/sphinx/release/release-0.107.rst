* Fixed task leak caused by queries that finish early, such as a ``LIMIT`` query
  or cancelled query, when the cluster is under high load.
* Added ``task.info-refresh-max-wait`` to configure task info freshness.
* Add support for ``DELETE`` to language and connector SPI.
* Reenable error classification code for syntax errors.
* Fix out of bounds exception in :func:`!lower` and :func:`!upper`
  when the string contains the code point ``U+10FFFF``.
