=============
Release 0.276
=============

.. warning::

   There is a lock contention in Hive connector which slows the query execution.

**Details**
===========

General Changes
_______________
* Fix a bug where a query with an order by clause and an unpartitioned window function sometimes returned unordered results.
* Improve Graphviz output for JOIN nodes and estimate stats.
* Reduce the number of hdfsConfiguration copies in the worker. This feature is enabled by default and can be controlled by setting the ``hive.copy-on-first-write-configuration`` configuration property appropriately.
* Add support for complex JsonPath expressions in :func:`json_extract`, :func:`json_extract_scalar` and :func:`json_size` using `Jayway JsonPath <https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath>`_.
* Add support to nested SQL functions with lambdas when ``inline_sql_functions = false``.
* Add the GeoPlugin by default. Previously it was an optional plugin.
* Add documentation for :doc:`/functions/tdigest`.
* Add ConnectorPlanRewriter utility to simplify writing Connector specific optimizer rules.
* Make ``query.max-total-memory-per-node property`` optional with default value dependent on ``query.max-memory-per-node``.

Hive Changes
____________
* Add support of function registration for interface `org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.UDF``.

Hudi Changes
____________
* Add sized-based split weights for Hudi connector to improve query performance. This is enabled by default, controlled by configuration property ``hudi.size-based-split-weights-enabled`` and session property ``hudi.size_based_split_weights_enabled``. Two more configuration properties are added to adjust the weight: ``hudi.standard-split-weight-size`` to configure the split size corresponding to the standard split weight, and ``hudi.minimum-assigned-split-weight`` to configure the minimum split weight.

Iceberg Changes
_______________
* Update Iceberg to 0.14.0.

Pinot Changes
_____________
* Fix an incorrect result issue caused by cross-join query pushdown by throwing errors instead of providing the wrong answer.
* Add new config ``pinot.attempt-broker-queries`` to attempt to pushdown queries to brokers.
* Add support for pinot controller and broker authentication with user and password.
* Add pushdown support for :func:`coalesce` function.

Router Changes
______________
* Add a round-robin scheduler.
* Add a weighted random choice scheduler.
* Add an optional config for the query predictor uri.
* Add presto router's doc.

Spark Changes
_____________
* Add a new configuration property ``spark.retry-on-out-of-memory-with-increased-memory-settings-enabled`` to enable picking up presto and spark memory settings and retry the query within the same spark session with the new settings applied.  This can be overridden by ``spark_retry_on_out_of_memory_with_increased_memory_settings_enabled`` session property.
* Add new configuration properties ``spark.retry-presto-session-properties`` and ``spark.retry-spark-configs`` to alter the Presto session properties and Spark settings during retry respectively. They can be overridden by ``out_of_memory_retry_presto_session_properties`` and ``out_of_memory_retry_spark_configs`` session properties.
* Add a new configuration property ``spark.resource-allocation-strategy-enabled`` and its session property ``spark_resource_allocation_strategy_enabled`` to allow optimized resource allocation strategy. This enables automatic executor and hash partition count to be estimated during planning time. The estimation could be bounded by configurations including ``spark.average-input-datasize-per-executor``, ``spark.max-executor-count``, ``spark.min-executor-count``, ``spark.average-input-datasize-per-partition``, ``spark.max-hash-partition-count``, and ``spark.min-hash-partition-count``. There are also corresponding session properties for these estimations.
