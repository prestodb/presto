=============
Release 0.273
=============

.. warning::

   There is a regression in query execution times due to way we are processing HdfsConfiguration
   and the issue is fixed in 0.273.2 release.

   There is a regression caused by airlift SSL changes that results in some queries failing with
   REMOTE_TASK_ERROR and the issue is fixed in 0.273.3.

**Highlights**
==============
* Add new Presto connector for Clickhouse.

**Details**
===========

General Changes
_______________
* Fix disaggregated coordinator resource group aggregation issue related to ``WAITING_FOR_PREREQUISITE`` queries. When a query is moved to WAITING_FOR_PREREQUISITE, resource manager would end up counting them towards running queries. This gives a wrong impression to coordinator about running queries and it would end up running less queries than configured.
* Fix a bug where ``EXPLAIN (TYPE IO)`` did not include the index source from an index join.
* Fix a memory over-counting issue for using varchar types that could cause queries to fail with exceeded memory limit errors.
* Fix an off-by-one error during buffer size calculation in :func:`tdigest_agg`.
* Fix memory tagging for UnnestOperator and TableWriterMergeOperator.
* Improve performance of :func: `zip_with` when used inside a :func:`reduce_agg`.
* Add :func:`to_base32` and :func:`from_base32` varbinary functions.
* Add support for ``TRUNCATE TABLE`` statement and associated :doc:`/sql/truncate`.
* Add support to set timeout on the query analyzer runtime to prevent long running query analysis like complex regular expressions. The timeout duration can be set by the configuration property ``planner.query-analyzer-timeout`` or session property ``query_analyzer_timeout``.
* Add :func:`trim_array` function that can be called to delete elements from the end of an ordinary array.
* Add a new optimization for showing results for (interactive) distinct limit N as they become available with no buffering.  This can be enabled by setting the session property ``quick_distinct_limit_enabled`` to true.
* Add support for casting timestamp with micro/nanosecond precision.
* Add Read support for json & jsonb data types in postgresql.
* Add support for local round robin shuffle to reduce the partial distinct limit output size.
* Add support for column subfield access control checks in connectors. Connectors can specify subfield access control for row-type columns through ``checkCanSelectFromColumns()`` in SPI.
* Add warnings for :func:`approx_distinct` and :func:`approx_set` with low ``MAX_STANDARD_ERROR``.
* Add support for retrying queries that failed with max requests queued exception.
* Update protoc and grpc version in presto-grpc-api module to adapt to linux aarch64.
* Upgrade zstandard compression to version 1.5.2.2. This improves the cpu used for data compressed with zstandard by about 2%.
* Upgrade postgresql driver to 42.3.3.

Clickhouse Changes
____________
* Add a Presto connector for Clickhouse with support of username/password authentication.

Hive Changes
____________
* Add a limit that prevents caching partitions with column counts greater than a configured threshold. This threshold can be set using the ``hive.partition-cache-column-count-limit`` configuration property.
* Add metastore configuration property ``hive.metastore.thrift.delete-files-on-table-drop`` to delete files on drop table.
* Add support for overwriting existing partitions with a Hive configuration property ``hive.insert-existing-partitions-behavior``. This configuration property supersedes the legacy one ``hive.insert-overwrite-immutable-partitions-enabled``. The new configuration property adds capability of overwriting new partitions for S3.
* Add support for timely Parquet metadata cache invalidation.
* Replace Hive session property ``streaming_aggregation_enabled`` with ``order_based_execution_enabled``.
* Replace Hive configuration property ``hive.streaming-aggregation-enabled`` with ``hive.order-based-execution-enabled``.

Iceberg Changes
_______________
* Fix Iceberg ``$files`` table in case of column dropping.
* Add ``$properties`` system table.
* Add support for storing column comments for Iceberg tables.
* Upgrade Iceberg to 0.13.1.

Mongodb Changes
_______________
* Add :func:`CAST(ObjectId() as STRING)`.

Pinot Changes
_____________
* Improve query performance by enabling pushdown of topn broker queries by default.
* Add double-quotes to Pinot generated queries to ensure that reserved keywords are escaped.
* Add TLS support in Pinot gRPC connection.
* Upgrade Pinot connector to support Pinot 0.10.0.

Spark Changes
_____________
* Improve handling of scenario where a query fails due to broadcast table violating node memory limit or broadcast limit. Previously the query failed while workers tried to load broadcast table causing container out of memory.
* Add a new configuration property ``spark.retry-on-out-of-memory-broadcast-join-enabled`` to disable broadcast join on broadcast OOM and retry the query again within the same spark session.  This can be overridden by ``spark_retry_on_out_of_memory_broadcast_join_enabled`` session property.

Verifier Changes
________________
* Add support to verifier for running control and test queries concurrently by setting ``concurrent-control-and-test`` configuration property to true.

SPI Changes
___________
* Add ``getInfoMap`` method in ``ConnectorSplit`` which returns a ``Map<String, String>``. This method should be preferred to the ``getInfo`` method which returns a raw object.
