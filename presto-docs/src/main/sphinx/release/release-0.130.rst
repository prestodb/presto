General Changes
---------------

* Fix a performance regression in ``GROUP BY`` and ``JOIN`` queries when the
  length of the keys is between 16 and 31 bytes.
* Add :func:`!map_concat` function.
* Performance improvements for filters, projections and dictionary encoded data.

  ``columnar_processing_dictionary`` session property.
* Improve performance of aggregation queries with large numbers of groups.
* Improve performance for queries that use :ref:`array_type` type.
* Fix querying remote views in MySQL and PostgreSQL connectors.
