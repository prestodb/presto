=============
Release 0.109
=============

General Changes
---------------

* Add :func:`!slice`, :func:`!md5`, :func:`!array_min` and :func:`!array_max` functions.
* Fix bug that could cause queries submitted soon after startup to hang forever.
* Fix bug that could cause ``JOIN`` queries to hang forever, if the right side of
  the ``JOIN`` had too little data or skewed data.
* Improve index join planning heuristics to favor streaming execution.
* Improve validation of date/time literals.
* Produce RPM package for Presto server.
* Always redistribute data when writing tables to avoid skew. This can
  be disabled by setting the session property ``redistribute_writes``
  or the config property ``redistribute-writes`` to false.

Remove "Big Query" Support
--------------------------
The experimental support for big queries has been removed in favor of
the new resource manager which can be enabled via the
``experimental.cluster-memory-manager-enabled`` config option.
The ``experimental_big_query`` session property and the following config
options are no longer supported: ``experimental.big-query-initial-hash-partitions``,
``experimental.max-concurrent-big-queries`` and ``experimental.max-queued-big-queries``.
