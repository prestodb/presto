Release 0.281
=============

**Details**
===========

General Changes
_______________
* Fix timeout for optimization rules by adding interrupt check between each optimizer rule, and throw meaningful exception.
* Improve memory accounting for rehashing for values by keeping both the new table and the old table, before this chage we account for the only size difference between the new table and the old table.
* Improve outer join where the join key is from the output of another outer join which can have many null values. The optimization is controlled by session property ``randomize_outer_join_null_key_strategy`` and the default value is ``DISABLED``
* Add ability to express concurrency levels as a function of number of available workers.
* Add an optimization rule for queries which have multiple similar aggregations, with and without filters. The optimization is controlled by session parameter ``merge_aggs_with_and_without_filter`` and by default it is set to ``false``.
* Add an optimization rule to merge aggregations when there are multiple duplicate aggregations in the aggregation node. The optimization is controlled by session property ``merge_duplicate_aggregations`` and default value is ``true``.
* Add :func:`f_cdf()` and :func:`inverse_f_cdf()` functions.
* Add :func:`gamma_cdf()`` and :func:`inverse_gamma_cdf()` functions.
* Add groups support to :doc:`/functions/window`.
* Add optimization for joins when build side is empty at runtime. The optimization is controlled by session parameter ``optimize_join_probe_for_empty_build_runtime`` and by default it is set to ``false``.
* Add system config to enable access log on presto-on-spark native. This can be enabled with the system config ``http-server.enable-access-log`` and default value is ``true``.
* Remove session property ``deprecated.legacy-date-timestamp-to-varchar-coercion``.
* Remove access control checks after semantic analysis. Queries with both semantic and permission issues that previously failed with permission errors may now fail with semantic errors.
* Reduce memory usage in parquet reader.

Resource Groups Changes
_______________________
* Add ``workersPerQueryLimit``, which specifies the minimum number of workers that have to be available for each query.

SPI Changes
___________
* Add various methods to create variables in the ``VariableAllocator``. ``VariableAllocator`` is also changed from interface to a class.
* Add ``MetadataResolver`` in the ``AnalyzerContext``, which is passed in the pluggable analyzer interface.


Hive Changes
____________
* Fix a bug where the filter on a ``CHAR(n)`` column is not evaluated correctly for ORC/DWRF files when filter pushdown is enabled.
* Fix issue while accessing HUDI Merge-on-Read Realtime tables (:issue:`18911`).
* Enable Hive splits for uncompressed inputs in S3 Select connector by leveraging the scan range feature of the service.

Apache Hudi Changes
____________
* Add the asynchronous split generation in Hudi connector to speed up the query execution and reduce overall query finishing time. ``hudi.max-outstanding-splits`` session property controls the maximum outstanding splits in a batch enqueued for processing.  ``hudi.split-generator-parallelism`` session property controls the number of threads to generate splits from partitions.
* Upgrade Apache Hudi version to 0.12.1.


Apache Iceberg Changes
_______________
* Upgrade Apache Iceberg version from 1.1.0 to 1.2.0.

JDBC Changes
____________
* Add ConnectorSession parameter to  all methods of ``JdbcClient`` interface. That makes it possible to pass specific options to JDBC driver implementation via session parameters.
