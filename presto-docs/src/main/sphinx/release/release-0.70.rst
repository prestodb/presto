============
Release 0.70
============

.. warning::

    This release contained a packaging error that resulted in an
    unusable server tarball. Do not use this release.

Views
-----

We have added support for creating views within Presto.
Views are defined using Presto syntax but are stored (as blobs)
by connectors. Currently, views are supported by the
Raptor and Hive connectors. For the Hive connector, views are
stored within the Hive metastore as Hive views, but they cannot
be queried by Hive, nor can Hive views be queried by Presto.

See :doc:`/sql/create-view` and :doc:`/sql/drop-view`
for details and examples.

DUAL Table
----------

The synthetic ``DUAL`` table is no longer supported. As an alternative, please
write your queries without a ``FROM`` clause or use the ``VALUES`` syntax.

Presto Verifier
---------------

There is a new project, :doc:`/admin/verifier`, which can be used to
verify a set of queries against two different clusters.

Connector Improvements
----------------------

* Connectors can now add hidden columns to a table. Hidden columns are not
  displayed in ``DESCRIBE`` or ``information_schema``, and are not
  considered for ``SELECT *``.  As an example, we have added a hidden
  ``row_number`` column to the ``tpch`` connector.

* Presto contains an extensive test suite to verify the correctness.  This test
  suite has been extracted into the ``presto-test`` module for use during
  connector development. For an example, see ``TestRaptorDistributedQueries``.

Machine Learning Functions
--------------------------

We have added two new machine learning functions, which can be used
by advanced users familiar with LIBSVM. The functions are
``learn_libsvm_classifier`` and ``learn_libsvm_regressor``. Both take a
parameters string which has the form ``key=value,key=value``

General Changes
---------------

* New comparison functions: :func:`!greatest` and :func:`!least`

* New window functions: :func:`!first_value`, :func:`!last_value`, and :func:`!nth_value`

* We have added a config option to disable falling back to the interpreter when
  expressions fail to be compiled to bytecode. To set this option, addÂ 
  ``compiler.interpreter-enabled=false`` to ``etc/config.properties``.
  This will force certain queries to fail rather than running slowly.

* ``DATE`` values are now implicitly coerced to ``TIMESTAMP`` and ``TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE``
  by setting the hour/minute/seconds to ``0`` with respect to the session timezone.

* Minor performance optimization when planning queries over tables with tens of
  thousands of partitions or more.

* Fixed a bug when planning ``ORDER BY ... LIMIT`` queries which could result in
  duplicate and un-ordered results under rare conditions.

* Reduce the size of stats collected from tasks, which dramatically reduces
  garbage generation and improves coordinator stability.

* Fix compiler cache for expressions.

* Fix processing of empty or commented out statements in the CLI.

Hive Changes
------------

* There are two new configuration options for the Hive connector,
  ``hive.max-initial-split-size``, which configures the size of the
  initial splits, and ``hive.max-initial-splits``, which configures
  the number of initial splits. This can be useful for speeding up small
  queries, which would otherwise have low parallelism.

* The Hive connector will now consider all tables with a non-empty value
  for the table property ``presto_offline`` to be offline. The value of the
  property will be used in the error message.

* We have added support for for ``DROP TABLE`` in the hive connector.
  By default, this feature is not enabled.  To enable it, set
  ``hive.allow-drop-table=true`` in your Hive catalog properties file.

* Ignore subdirectories when generating splits
  (this now matches the non-recursive behavior of Hive).

* Fix handling of maps with null keys.
