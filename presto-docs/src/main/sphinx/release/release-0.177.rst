=============
Release 0.177
=============

.. warning::

    Query may incorrectly produce ``NULL`` when no row qualifies for the aggregation
    if the ``optimize_mixed_distinct_aggregations`` session property or
    the ``optimizer.optimize-mixed-distinct-aggregations`` config option is enabled.
    This optimization was introduced in Presto version 0.156.

General Changes
---------------

* Fix correctness issue when performing range comparisons over columns of type ``CHAR``.
* Fix correctness issue due to mishandling of nulls and non-deterministic expressions in
  inequality joins unless ``fast_inequality_join`` is disabled.
* Fix excessive GC overhead caused by lambda expressions. There are still known GC issues
  with captured lambda expressions. This will be fixed in a future release.
* Check for duplicate columns in ``CREATE TABLE`` before asking the connector to create
  the table. This improves the error message for most connectors and will prevent errors
  for connectors that do not perform validation internally.
* Add support for null values on the left-hand side of a semijoin (i.e., ``IN`` predicate
  with subqueries).
* Add ``SHOW STATS`` to display table and query statistics.
* Improve implicit coercion support for functions involving lambda. Specifically, this makes
  it easier to use the :func:`!reduce` function.
* Improve plans for queries involving ``ORDER BY`` and ``LIMIT`` by avoiding unnecessary
  data exchanges.
* Improve performance of queries containing window functions with identical ``PARTITION BY``
  and ``ORDER BY`` clauses.
* Improve performance of certain queries involving ``OUTER JOIN`` and aggregations, or
  containing certain forms of correlated subqueries. This optimization is experimental
  and can be turned on via the ``push_aggregation_through_join`` session property or the
  ``optimizer.push-aggregation-through-join`` config option.
* Improve performance of certain queries involving joins and aggregations.  This optimization
  is experimental and can be turned on via the ``push_partial_aggregation_through_join``
  session property.
* Improve error message when a lambda expression has a different number of arguments than expected.
* Improve error message when certain invalid ``GROUP BY`` expressions containing lambda expressions.

Hive Changes
------------

* Fix handling of trailing spaces for the ``CHAR`` type when reading RCFile.
* Allow inserts into tables that have more partitions than the partitions-per-scan limit.
* Add support for exposing Hive table statistics to the engine. This option is experimental and
  can be turned on via the ``statistics_enabled`` session property.
* Ensure file name is always present for error messages about corrupt ORC files.

Cassandra Changes
-----------------

* Remove caching of metadata in the Cassandra connector. Metadata caching makes Presto violate
  the consistency defined by the Cassandra cluster. It's also unnecessary because the Cassandra
  driver internally caches metadata. The ``cassandra.max-schema-refresh-threads``,
  ``cassandra.schema-cache-ttl`` and ``cassandra.schema-refresh-interval`` config options have
  been removed.
* Fix intermittent issue in the connection retry mechanism.

Web UI Changes
--------------

* Change cluster HUD realtime statistics to be aggregated across all running queries.
* Change parallelism statistic on cluster HUD to be averaged per-worker.
* Fix bug that always showed indeterminate progress bar in query list view.
* Change running drivers statistic to exclude blocked drivers.
* Change unit of CPU and scheduled time rate sparklines to seconds on query details page.
* Change query details page refresh interval to three seconds.
* Add uptime and connected status indicators to every page.

CLI Changes
-----------

* Add support for preprocessing commands.  When the ``PRESTO_PREPROCESSOR`` environment
  variable is set, all commands are piped through the specified program before being sent to
  the Presto server.
