=============
Release 0.124
=============

General Changes
---------------

* Fix race in memory tracking of ``JOIN`` which could cause the cluster to become over
  committed and possibly crash.
* The :func:`!approx_percentile` aggregation now also accepts an array of percentages.
* Allow nested row type references.
* Fix correctness for some queries with ``IN`` lists. When all constants in the
  list are in the range of 32-bit signed integers but the test value can be
  outside of the range, ``true`` may be produced when the correct result should
  be ``false``.
* Fail queries submitted while coordinator is starting.
* Add JMX stats to track authentication and authorization successes and failures.
* Add configuration support for the system access control plugin. The system access
  controller can be selected and configured using ``etc/access-control.properties``.
  Note that Presto currently does not ship with any system access controller
  implementations.
* Add support for ``WITH NO DATA`` syntax in ``CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT``.
* Fix issue where invalid plans are generated for queries with multiple aggregations
  that require input values to be cast in different ways.
* Fix performance issue due to redundant processing in queries involving ``DISTINCT``
  and ``LIMIT``.
* Add optimization that can reduce the amount of data sent over the network
  for grouped aggregation queries. This feature can be enabled by
  ``optimizer.use-intermediate-aggregations`` config property or
  ``task_intermediate_aggregation`` session property.

Hive Changes
------------

* Do not count expected exceptions as errors in the Hive metastore client stats.
* Improve performance when reading ORC files with many tiny stripes.

Verifier
--------

* Add support for pre and post control and test queries.

If you are upgrading, you need to alter your ``verifier_queries`` table::

    ALTER TABLE verifier_queries ADD COLUMN test_postqueries text;
    ALTER TABLE verifier_queries ADD COLUMN test_prequeries text;
    ALTER TABLE verifier_queries ADD COLUMN control_postqueries text;
    ALTER TABLE verifier_queries ADD COLUMN control_prequeries text;
