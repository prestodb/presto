============
Release 0.54
============

* Restore binding for the node resource on the coordinator, which provides
  the state of all nodes as seen by the coordinator's failure detector.
  Access ``/v1/node`` to see all nodes, or ``/v1/node/failed`` to see failed nodes.

* Prevent the :doc:`/clients/presto-cli` from hanging when the server goes away.

* Add Hive connector ``hive-hadoop1`` for Apache Hadoop 1.x.

* Add support for Snappy and LZ4 compression codecs for the ``hive-cdh4`` connector.

* Add Example HTTP connector ``example-http`` that reads CSV data via HTTP.
  The connector requires a metadata URI that returns a JSON document
  describing the table metadata and the CSV files to read.

  Its primary purpose is to serve as an example of how to write a connector,
  but it can also be used directly. Create ``etc/catalog/example.properties``
  with the following contents to mount the ``example-http`` connector as the
  ``example`` catalog:

  .. code-block:: none

      connector.name=example-http
      metadata-uri=http://s3.amazonaws.com/presto-example/v1/example-metadata.json

* Show correct error message when a catalog or schema does not exist.

* Verify JVM requirements on startup.

* Log an error when the JVM code cache is full.

* Upgrade the embedded Discovery server to allow using
  non-UUID values for the ``node.id`` property.
