=============
Release 0.126
=============

General Changes
---------------

* Add error location information (line and column number) for semantic errors.
* Fix a CLI crash during tab-completion when no schema is currently selected.
* Fix reset of session properties in CLI when running :doc:`/sql/use`.
* Fix occasional query planning failure due to a bug in the projection
  push down optimizer.
* Fix a parsing issue when expressions contain the form ``POSITION(x in (y))``.
* Add a new version of :func:`!approx_percentile` that takes an ``accuracy``
  parameter.
* Allow specifying columns names in :doc:`/sql/insert` queries.
* Add ``field_length`` table property to blackhole connector to control the
  size of generated ``VARCHAR`` and ``VARBINARY`` fields.
* Bundle Teradata functions plugin in server package.
* Improve handling of physical properties which can increase performance for
  queries involving window functions.
* Add ability to control whether index join lookups and caching are shared
  within a task. This allows us to optimize for index cache hits or for more
  CPU parallelism. This option is toggled by the ``task.share-index-loading``
  config property or the ``task_share_index_loading`` session property.
* Add :doc:`Tableau web connector </installation/tableau>`.
* Improve performance of queries that use an ``IN`` expression with a large
  list of constant values.
* Enable connector predicate push down for all comparable and equatable types.
* Fix query planning failure when using certain operations such as ``GROUP BY``,
  ``DISTINCT``, etc. on the output columns of ``UNNEST``.
* In ``ExchangeClient`` set ``maxResponseSize`` to be slightly smaller than
  the configured value. This reduces the possibility of encountering
  ``PageTooLargeException``.
* Fix memory leak in coordinator.
* Add validation for names of table properties.

Hive Changes
------------

* Fix reading structural types containing nulls in Parquet.
* Fix writing DATE type when timezone offset is negative. Previous versions
  would write the wrong date (off by one day).
* Fix an issue where ``VARCHAR`` columns added to an existing table could not be
  queried.
* Fix over-creation of initial splits.
* Fix ``hive.immutable-partitions`` config property to also apply to
  unpartitioned tables.
* Allow non-``VARCHAR`` columns in ``DELETE`` query.
* Support ``DATE`` columns as partition columns in parquet tables.
* Improve error message for cases where partition columns are also table columns.
