Release 0.282
=============

**Details**
===========

General Changes
_______________
* Fix ``TEMPORARY`` definition :doc:`/sql/create-function` and :doc:`/sql/drop-function`.
* Fix a bug where ``cardinality(map_keys(x))`` and ``cardinality(map_values(x))`` would return wrong results.
* Improve performance of ``Explain (TYPE VALIDATE)`` by returning immediately after analysis and ACL checks complete without executing a dummy query. The output column is now called ``result`` rather than ``valid``.
* Improve error handling when using custom ``FunctionNamespaceManagers``.
* Improve null inferencing for join nodes. ``optimize_nulls_in_join`` session property is deprecated and is instead replaced with a new ``joins_not_null_inference_strategy`` session property (and corresponding configuration property ``optimizer.joins-not-null-inference-strategy``) to control null inferencing.
* Add a new UDF :func:`array_cum_sum` to return an array whose elements are the cumulative sum of the input array.
* Add a query optimization to rewrite left join with null check on right join key with semi join. It's controlled by session property ``rewrite_left_join_null_filter_to_semi_join`` and the default value is ``true``
* Add an optimization for queries with empty input. The optimization is controlled by session property ``simplify_plan_with_empty_input`` and the default value is ``true``
* Add an optimization to convert applicable cross join with an or filter to inner join. It's controlled by session property ``rewrite_cross_join_or_to_inner_join`` and the default value is ``true``
* Add an optimization to optimize cross join with array contains filter, it's controlled by session parameter ``rewrite_cross_join_array_contains_to_inner_join`` and the default value is ``true``
* Add an optimization to push down filter expression evaluation through cross join. It's controlled by session property ``push_down_filter_expression_evaluation_through_cross_join`` and the default value is ``REWRITTEN_TO_INNER_JOIN``
* Add preprocessing for metadata calls required for analysis. This feature is disabled by default and controlled by session property ``pre_process_metadata_calls``.
* Upgrade Joda version to 2.12.2. Note: a corresponding update to the Java runtime should also be made to ensure consistent timezone data.
* Upgrade AWS SDK version to 1.12.261.

Hive Changes
____________
* Remove the implementation of Alluxio's metadata store because this feature won't be supported in Alluxio 3.0.0.
* Upgrade Alluxio version from 2.8.1 to 2.9.3.

Apache Iceberg Changes
____________
* Add parquet metadata caching in Apache Iceberg.

Presto on Spark Changes
____________
* Add option to use ``selectAuthorizedIdentity`` API for Presto on Spark when ``permissions.authorized-identity-selection-enable`` set to ``true``.
* Add an additional field  ``attemptNumber`` in ``TaskId`` which is used to capture task retries in Presto on Spark. For presto classic this field will be set to ``0`` by default.
* Remove :doc:`/sql/create-function` and :doc:`/sql/drop-function` support from Presto on Spark.

JDBC Changes
____________
* Fix ``TRUNCATE TABLE`` for JDBC connector.

Resource Group Changes
______________________
* Add schema support in resource group ``StaticSelector``.
