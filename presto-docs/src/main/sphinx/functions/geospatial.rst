Geospatial Functions
====================

Presto Geospatial functions that begin with the ``ST_`` prefix support the
SQL/MM specification and are compliant with the Open Geospatial Consortiumâ€™s
(OGC) OpenGIS Specifications.  As such, many Presto Geospatial functions
require, or more accurately, assume that geometries that are operated on are
both simple and valid. For example, it does not make sense to calculate the
area of a polygon that has a hole defined outside of the polygon, or to
construct a polygon from a non-simple boundary line.

Presto Geospatial functions support the Well-Known Text (WKT) and Well-Known
Binary (WKB) form of spatial objects:

* ``POINT (0 0)``
* ``LINESTRING (0 0, 1 1, 1 2)``
* ``POLYGON ((0 0, 4 0, 4 4, 0 4, 0 0), (1 1, 2 1, 2 2, 1 2, 1 1))``
* ``MULTIPOINT (0 0, 1 2)``
* ``MULTILINESTRING ((0 0, 1 1, 1 2), (2 3, 3 2, 5 4))``
* ``MULTIPOLYGON (((0 0, 4 0, 4 4, 0 4, 0 0), (1 1, 2 1, 2 2, 1 2, 1 1)), ((-1 -1, -1 -2, -2 -2, -2 -1, -1 -1)))``
* ``GEOMETRYCOLLECTION (POINT(2 3), LINESTRING (2 3, 3 4))``

Use ``ST_GeometryFromText`` and ``ST_GeomFromBinary`` functions to create
geometry objects from WKT or WKB.  In WKT/WKB, the coordinate order is
``(x, y)``.  For spherical/geospatial uses, this implies
``(longitude, latitude)`` instead of ``(latitude, longitude)``.

The basis for the ``Geometry`` type is a plane. The shortest path between two
points on the plane is a straight line. That means calculations on geometries
(areas, distances, lengths, intersections, etc) can be calculated using
cartesian mathematics and straight line vectors.

The ``SphericalGeography`` type provides native support for spatial features
represented on "geographic" coordinates (sometimes called "geodetic"
coordinates, or "lat/lon", or "lon/lat"). Geographic coordinates are spherical
coordinates expressed in angular units (degrees).

The basis for the ``SphericalGeography`` type is a sphere. The shortest path
between two points on the sphere is a great circle arc. That means that
calculations on geographies (areas, distances, lengths, intersections, etc)
must be calculated on the sphere, using more complicated mathematics. More
accurate measurements that take the actual spheroidal shape of the world into
account are not supported.

For ``SphericalGeography`` objects, values returned by the measurement functions
``ST_Distance`` and ``ST_Length`` are in the unit of meters; values returned by
``ST_Area`` are in square meters.

Use ``to_spherical_geography()`` function to convert a geometry object to
geography object.  For example,
``ST_Distance(ST_Point(-71.0882, 42.3607), ST_Point(-74.1197, 40.6976))``
returns 3.4577 in the unit of the passed-in values on the euclidean plane,
while
``ST_Distance(to_spherical_geography(ST_Point(-71.0882, 42.3607)), to_spherical_geography(ST_Point(-74.1197, 40.6976)))``
returns 312822.179 in meters.


Constructors
------------

.. function:: ST_AsBinary(Geometry) -> varbinary

    Returns the WKB representation of the geometry.

.. function:: ST_AsText(Geometry) -> varchar

    Returns the WKT representation of the geometry. For empty geometries,
    ``ST_AsText(ST_LineFromText('LINESTRING EMPTY'))`` will produce
    ``'MULTILINESTRING EMPTY'`` and ``ST_AsText(ST_Polygon('POLYGON EMPTY'))``
    will produce ``'MULTIPOLYGON EMPTY'``.

.. function:: ST_GeometryFromText(varchar) -> Geometry

    Returns a geometry type object from WKT representation.

.. function:: ST_GeomFromBinary(varbinary) -> Geometry

    Returns a geometry type object from WKB representation.

.. function:: ST_LineFromText(varchar) -> LineString

    Returns a geometry type linestring object from WKT representation.

.. function:: ST_LineString(array(Point)) -> LineString

    Returns a LineString formed from an array of points. If there are fewer
    than two non-empty points in the input array, an empty LineString will be
    returned.  Throws an exception if any element in the array is ``null`` or
    empty or same as the previous one.  The returned geometry may not be
    simple, e.g. may self-intersect or may contain duplicate vertexes depending
    on the input.

.. function:: ST_MultiPoint(array(Point)) -> MultiPoint

    Returns a MultiPoint geometry object formed from the specified points.
    Return ``null`` if input array is empty.  Throws an exception if any element
    in the array is ``null`` or empty.  The returned geometry may not be simple
    and may contain duplicate points if input array has duplicates.

.. function:: ST_Point(x, y) -> Point

    Returns a geometry type point object with the given coordinate values.

.. function:: ST_Polygon(varchar) -> Polygon

    Returns a geometry type polygon object from WKT representation.

.. function:: to_spherical_geography(Geometry) -> SphericalGeography

    Converts a Geometry object to a SphericalGeography object on the sphere of
    the Earth's radius. This function is only applicable to ``POINT``,
    ``MULTIPOINT``, ``LINESTRING``, ``MULTILINESTRING``, ``POLYGON``,
    ``MULTIPOLYGON`` geometries defined in 2D space, or ``GEOMETRYCOLLECTION``
    of such geometries. For each point of the input geometry, it verifies that
    point.x is within [-180.0, 180.0] and point.y is within [-90.0, 90.0], and
    uses them as (longitude, latitude) degrees to construct the shape of the
    ``SphericalGeography`` result.

    Returns ``true`` if first geometry is completely inside second geometry.

Operations
----------

.. function:: geometry_union(array(Geometry)) -> Geometry

    Returns a geometry that represents the point set union of the input
    geometries. Performance of this function, in conjunction with
    :func:`array_agg` to first aggregate the input geometries, may be better

    might return an empty geometry.

.. function:: ST_Difference(Geometry, Geometry) -> Geometry

    Returns the geometry value that represents the point set difference of the
    given geometries.

.. function:: ST_Envelope(Geometry) -> Geometry

    Returns the bounding rectangular polygon of a geometry.

.. function:: ST_EnvelopeAsPts(Geometry) -> array(Geometry)

    Returns an array of two points: the lower left and upper right corners of

    geometry is empty.

.. function:: expand_envelope(Geometry, double) -> Geometry

.. function:: ST_Intersection(Geometry, Geometry) -> Geometry

    Returns the geometry value that represents the point set intersection of
    two geometries.

    Returns the geometry value that represents the point set symmetric
    difference of two geometries.

    If the geometry is a collection of geometries (e.g., GEOMETRYCOLLECTION or MULTI*),
    returns the geometry at a given index.
    If the given index is less than 1 or greater than the total number of elements in the collection,
    returns ``NULL``.
    Use :func:``ST_NumGeometries`` to find out the total number of elements.
    Singular geometries (e.g., POINT, LINESTRING, POLYGON), are treated as collections of one element.
    Empty geometries are treated as empty collections.

.. function:: ST_InteriorRingN(Geometry, index) -> Geometry

   Returns the interior ring element at the specified index (indices start at 1). If
   the given index is less than 1 or greater than the total number of interior rings
   in the input geometry, returns ``NULL``. Throws an error if the input geometry is

    Returns ``true`` if and only if the line is closed and simple.

.. function:: ST_IsValid(Geometry) -> boolean

    This is a shortcut for ``ST_PointN(geometry, 1)``.

.. function:: ST_EndPoint(Geometry) -> point

   Returns an array of geometries in the specified collection. Returns a one-element array
   if the input geometry is not a multi-geometry. Returns ``null`` if input geometry is empty.

   For example, a MultiLineString will create an array of LineStrings.  A GeometryCollection
   will produce an un-flattened array of its constituents:
   ``GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(MULTIPOINT(0 0, 1 1), GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(MULTILINESTRING((2 2, 3 3))))``
   would produce ``array[MULTIPOINT(0 0, 1 1), GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(MULTILINESTRING((2 2, 3 3)))]``.

.. function:: flatten_geometry_collections(Geometry) -> array(Geometry)

    Recursively flattens any GeometryCollections in Geometry, returning an array
    of constituent non-GeometryCollection geometries.  The order of the array is
    arbitrary and should not be relied upon.  Examples:

    ``POINT (0 0) -> [POINT (0 0)]``,
    ``MULTIPOINT (0 0, 1 1) -> [MULTIPOINT (0 0, 1 1)]``,
    ``GEOMETRYCOLLECTION (POINT (0 0), GEOMETRYCOLLECTION (POINT (1 1))) -> [POINT (0 0), POINT (1 1)]``,
    ``GEOMETRYCOLLECTION EMPTY -> []``.

.. function:: ST_NumPoints(Geometry) -> bigint

    ``ST_NumPoints`` function which only applies to point and linestring.

.. function:: ST_NumInteriorRing(Geometry) -> bigint

    Returns the cardinality of the collection of interior rings of a polygon.

.. function:: simplify_geometry(Geometry, double) -> Geometry

.. function:: line_interpolate_point(LineString, double) -> Geometry

    Returns the Point on the LineString at a fractional distance given by the
    double argument.  Throws an exception if the distance is not between 0 and 1.

    Returns an empty Point if the LineString is empty.  Returns ``null`` if
    either the LineString or double is null.

.. function:: geometry_invalid_reason(Geometry) -> varchar

    Returns the reason for why the input geometry is not valid or not simple.
    If the geometry is neither valid no simple, it will only give the reason
    for invalidity.
    Returns ``null`` if the input is valid and simple.

.. function:: great_circle_distance(latitude1, longitude1, latitude2, longitude2) -> double

    Returns the great-circle distance between two points on Earth's surface in kilometers.

.. function:: geometry_as_geojson(Geometry) -> varchar

    Returns the GeoJSON encoded defined by the input geometry.
    If the geometry is atomic (non-multi) empty, this function would return null.

.. function:: geometry_from_geojson(varchar) -> Geometry

    Returns the geometry type object from the GeoJSON representation.
    The geometry cannot be empty if it is an atomic (non-multi) geometry type.

Aggregations
------------
.. function:: convex_hull_agg(Geometry) -> Geometry

    Returns the minimum convex geometry that encloses all input geometries.

.. function:: geometry_union_agg(Geometry) -> Geometry

    Returns a geometry that represents the point set union of all input geometries.

Bing Tiles
----------

These functions convert between geometries and
`Bing tiles <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb259689.aspx>`_.  For
Bing tiles, ``x`` and ``y`` refer to ``tile_x`` and ``tile_y``.  Bing Tiles
can be cast to and from BigInts, using an internal representation that encodes
the ``zoom``, ``x``, and ``y`` efficiently::

    cast(cast(tile AS BIGINT) AS BINGTILE)

While every tile can be cast to a bigint, casting from a bigint that does not
represent a valid tile will raise an exception.


.. function:: bing_tile(x, y, zoom_level) -> BingTile

    Creates a Bing tile object from XY coordinates and a zoom level.
    Zoom levels from 1 to 23 are supported.

.. function:: bing_tile(quadKey) -> BingTile

    Creates a Bing tile object from a quadkey.

.. function:: bing_tile_parent(tile) -> BingTile

    Returns the parent of the Bing tile at one lower zoom level.
    Throws an exception if tile is at zoom level 0.

.. function:: bing_tile_parent(tile, newZoom) -> BingTile

    Returns the parent of the Bing tile at the specified lower zoom level.
    Throws an exception if newZoom is less than 0, or newZoom is greater than
    the tile's zoom.

.. function:: bing_tile_children(tile) -> array(BingTile)

    Returns the children of the Bing tile at one higher zoom level.
    Throws an exception if tile is at max zoom level.

.. function:: bing_tile_children(tile, newZoom) -> array(BingTile)

    Returns the children of the Bing tile at the specified higher zoom level.
    Throws an exception if newZoom is greater than the max zoom level, or
    newZoom is less than the tile's zoom.

.. function:: bing_tile_at(latitude, longitude, zoom_level) -> BingTile

    Returns a Bing tile at a given zoom level containing a point at a given latitude
    and longitude. Latitude must be within ``[-85.05112878, 85.05112878]`` range.
    Longitude must be within ``[-180, 180]`` range. Zoom levels from 1 to 23 are supported.

.. function:: bing_tiles_around(latitude, longitude, zoom_level) -> array(BingTile)

    Returns a collection of Bing tiles that surround the point specified
    by the latitude and longitude arguments at a given zoom level.

.. function:: bing_tiles_around(latitude, longitude, zoom_level, radius_in_km) -> array(BingTile)

.. function:: geometry_to_bing_tiles(geometry, zoom_level) -> array(BingTile)

    Returns the minimum set of Bing tiles that fully covers a given geometry at
    a given zoom level. Zoom levels from 1 to 23 are supported.

.. function:: geometry_to_dissolved_bing_tiles(geometry, max_zoom_level) -> array(BingTile)

    Returns the minimum set of Bing tiles that fully covers a given geometry at
    a given zoom level, recursively dissolving full sets of children into parents.
    This results in a smaller array of tiles of different zoom levels. For example,
    if the non-dissolved covering is ["00", "01", "02", "03", "10"], the dissolved
    covering would be ["0", "10"]. Zoom levels from 1 to 23 are supported.
