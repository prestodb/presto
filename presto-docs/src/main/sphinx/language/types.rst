Boolean
-------

``BOOLEAN``
^^^^^^^^^^^

    This type captures boolean values ``true`` and ``false``.

Integer
-------

``TINYINT``
^^^^^^^^^^^

    A 8-bit signed two's complement integer with a minimum value of
    ``-2^7`` and a maximum value of ``2^7 - 1``.

``SMALLINT``
^^^^^^^^^^^^

    A 16-bit signed two's complement integer with a minimum value of
    ``-2^15`` and a maximum value of ``2^15 - 1``.

``INTEGER``
^^^^^^^^^^^

    A 32-bit signed two's complement integer with a minimum value of
    ``-2^31`` and a maximum value of ``2^31 - 1``.  The name ``INT`` is
    also available for this type.

``BIGINT``
^^^^^^^^^^

    A 64-bit signed two's complement integer with a minimum value of
    ``-2^63`` and a maximum value of ``2^63 - 1``.

Floating-Point
--------------

``REAL``
^^^^^^^^

    A real is a 32-bit inexact, variable-precision implementing the
    IEEE Standard 754 for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic.

``DOUBLE``
^^^^^^^^^^

    A double is a 64-bit inexact, variable-precision implementing the
    IEEE Standard 754 for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic.

Fixed-Precision
---------------

``DECIMAL``
^^^^^^^^^^^

    A fixed precision decimal number. Precision up to 38 digits is supported
    but performance is best up to 18 digits.

    The decimal type takes two literal parameters:

      - **precision** - total number of digits

      - **scale** - number of digits in fractional part. Scale is optional and defaults to 0.

    Example type definitions: ``DECIMAL(10,3)``, ``DECIMAL(20)``

    Example literals: ``DECIMAL '10.3'``, ``DECIMAL '1234567890'``, ``1.1``

    .. note::

        For compatibility reasons decimal literals without explicit type specifier (e.g. ``1.2``)
        are treated as values of the ``DOUBLE`` type by default up to version 0.198. 
        After 0.198 they are parsed as DECIMAL.

          - System wide property: ``parse-decimal-literals-as-double``
          - Session wide property: ``parse_decimal_literals_as_double``

String
------

``VARCHAR``
^^^^^^^^^^^

    Variable length character data with an optional maximum length.

    Example type definitions: ``varchar``, ``varchar(20)``

``CHAR``
^^^^^^^^

    Fixed length character data. A ``CHAR`` type without length specified has a default length of 1.
    A ``CHAR(x)`` value always has ``x`` characters. For instance, casting ``dog`` to ``CHAR(7)``
    adds 4 implicit trailing spaces. Leading and trailing spaces are included in comparisons of
    ``CHAR`` values. As a result, two character values with different lengths (``CHAR(x)`` and
    ``CHAR(y)`` where ``x != y``) will never be equal.

    Example type definitions: ``char``, ``char(20)``

``VARBINARY``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Variable length binary data.

    .. note::

        Binary strings with length are not yet supported: ``varbinary(n)``

``JSON``
^^^^^^^^

    JSON value type, which can be a JSON object, a JSON array, a JSON number, a JSON string,
    ``true``, ``false`` or ``null``.

Date and Time
-------------

``DATE``
^^^^^^^^

    Calendar date (year, month, day).

    Example: ``DATE '2001-08-22'``

``TIME``
^^^^^^^^

    Time of day (hour, minute, second, millisecond) without a time zone.
    Values of this type are parsed and rendered in the session time zone.

    Example: ``TIME '01:02:03.456'``

``TIME WITH TIME ZONE``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Time of day (hour, minute, second, millisecond) with a time zone.
    Values of this type are rendered using the time zone from the value.

    Example: ``TIME '01:02:03.456 America/Los_Angeles'``

``TIMESTAMP``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Instant in time that includes the date and time of day without a time zone.
    Values of this type are parsed and rendered in the session time zone.

    Example: ``TIMESTAMP '2001-08-22 03:04:05.321'``

``TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Instant in time that includes the date and time of day with a time zone.
    Values of this type are rendered using the time zone from the value.

    Example: ``TIMESTAMP '2001-08-22 03:04:05.321 America/Los_Angeles'``

``INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Span of years and months.

    Example: ``INTERVAL '3' MONTH``

``INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Span of days, hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds.

    Example: ``INTERVAL '2' DAY``

Structural
----------

.. _array_type:

``ARRAY``
^^^^^^^^^

    An array of the given component type.

    Example: ``ARRAY[1, 2, 3]``

.. _map_type:

``MAP``
^^^^^^^

    A map between the given component types.

    Example: ``MAP(ARRAY['foo', 'bar'], ARRAY[1, 2])``

.. _row_type:

``ROW``
^^^^^^^

    A structure made up of named fields. The fields may be of any SQL type, and are
    accessed with field reference operator ``.``

    Example: ``CAST(ROW(1, 2.0) AS ROW(x BIGINT, y DOUBLE))``

Network Address
---------------

.. _ipaddress_type:

``IPADDRESS``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    An IP address that can represent either an IPv4 or IPv6 address.

    Internally, the type is a pure IPv6 address. Support for IPv4 is handled
    using the *IPv4-mapped IPv6 address* range (:rfc:`4291#section-2.5.5.2`).
    When creating an ``IPADDRESS``, IPv4 addresses will be mapped into that range.

    When formatting an ``IPADDRESS``, any address within the mapped range will
    be formatted as an IPv4 address. Other addresses will be formatted as IPv6
    using the canonical format defined in :rfc:`5952`.

    Examples: ``IPADDRESS '10.0.0.1'``, ``IPADDRESS '2001:db8::1'``

UUID
----

.. _uuid_type:

``UUID``
^^^^^^^^

    This type represents a UUID (Universally Unique IDentifier), also known as a
    GUID (Globally Unique IDentifier), using the format defined in :rfc:`4122`.

    Example: ``UUID '12151fd2-7586-11e9-8f9e-2a86e4085a59'``

.. _ipprefix_type:

``IPPREFIX``
^^^^^^^^^^^^

    An IP routing prefix that can represent either an IPv4 or IPv6 address.

    Internally, an address is a pure IPv6 address. Support for IPv4 is handled
    using the *IPv4-mapped IPv6 address* range (:rfc:`4291#section-2.5.5.2`).
    When creating an ``IPPREFIX``, IPv4 addresses will be mapped into that range.
    Additionally, addresses will be reduced to the first address of a network.

    ``IPPREFIX`` values will be formatted in CIDR notation, written as an IP
    address, a slash ('/') character, and the bit-length of the prefix. Any
    address within the IPv4-mapped IPv6 address range will be formatted as an
    IPv4 address. Other addresses will be formatted as IPv6 using the canonical
    format defined in :rfc:`5952`.

    Examples: ``IPPREFIX '10.0.1.0/24'``, ``IPPREFIX '2001:db8::/48'``

HyperLogLog
-----------

Calculating the approximate distinct count can be done much more cheaply than an exact count using the
`HyperLogLog <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog>`_ data sketch. See :doc:`/functions/hyperloglog`.

.. _hyperloglog_type:

``HyperLogLog``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    A HyperLogLog sketch allows efficient computation of :func:`approx_distinct`. It starts as a
    sparse representation, switching to a dense representation when it becomes more efficient.

.. _p4hyperloglog_type:

``P4HyperLogLog``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    A P4HyperLogLog sketch is similar to :ref:`hyperloglog_type`, but it starts (and remains)
    in the dense representation.

KHyperLogLog
------------

.. _khyperloglog_type:

``KHyperLogLog``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    A KHyperLogLog is a data sketch that can be used to compactly represents the association of two
    columns. See :doc:`/functions/khyperloglog`.

Quantile Digest
---------------

.. _qdigest_type:

``QDigest``
^^^^^^^^^^^

    A quantile digest (qdigest) is a summary structure which captures the approximate
    distribution of data for a given input set, and can be queried to retrieve approximate
    quantile values from the distribution.  The level of accuracy for a qdigest
    is tunable, allowing for more precise results at the expense of space.

    A qdigest can be used to give approximate answer to queries asking for what value
    belongs at a certain quantile.  A useful property of qdigests is that they are
    additive, meaning they can be merged together without losing precision.

    A qdigest may be helpful whenever the partial results of ``approx_percentile``
    can be reused.  For example, one may be interested in a daily reading of the 99th
    percentile values that are read over the course of a week.  Instead of calculating
    the past week of data with ``approx_percentile``, ``qdigest``\ s could be stored
    daily, and quickly merged to retrieve the 99th percentile value.

    See :doc:`/functions/qdigest`.

T-Digest
---------------

.. _tdigest_type:

``TDigest``
^^^^^^^^^^^

    A t-digest is similar to :ref:`qdigest <qdigest_type>`, but it uses `a different algorithm
    <http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/347090.347195>`_ to represent the approximate distribution of a set
    of numbers. T-digest has better performance than quantile digests but only supports the
    ``DOUBLE`` type. See :doc:`/functions/tdigest`.
