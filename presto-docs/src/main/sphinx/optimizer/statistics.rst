Table Statistics
================

Presto supports statistics based optimizations for queries. For a query to take
advantage of these optimizations, Presto must have statistical information for
the tables in that query.

Table statistics are provided to the query planner by connectors. Implementing
support for table statistics is optional. The decision is left to the authors
of the connector.

Table Layouts
-------------

Statistics are exposed to the query planner by a table layout. A table layout
represents a subset of a table's data and contains information about the
organizational properties of that data (like sort order and bucketing).

The number of table layouts available for a table and the details of those table
layouts are specific to each connector.  Using the Hive connector as an example:

* Non-partitioned tables have just one table layout representing all data in the table
* Partitioned tables have a family of table layouts. Each set of partitions to
  be scanned represents one table layout.  Presto will try to pick a table
  layout consisting of the smallest number of partitions based on filtering
  predicates from the query.

Available Statistics
--------------------

The following statistics are available in Presto:

* For a table:

  * **row count**: the total number of rows in the table layout

* For each column in a table:

  * **data size**: the size of the data that needs to be read
  * **nulls fraction**: the fraction of null values
  * **distinct value count**: the number of distinct values
  * **low value**: the smallest value in the column
  * **high value**: the largest value in the column
  * **histogram**: A connector-dependent histogram data structure.

The set of statistics available for a particular query depends on the connector
being used and can also vary by table or even by table layout. For example, the
Hive connector does not currently provide statistics on data size.

Table statistics can be can be fetched using the :doc:`/sql/show-stats` query.
For the Hive connector, refer to the :ref:`Hive connector <hive_analyze>`
documentation to learn how to update table statistics.
