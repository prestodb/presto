     * aliases from source nodes must be in a Matcher's detailMatches method.
     * <p>
     * The detailMatches method may collect Symbol aliases from the node that it is
     * being applied to, and return them in the MatchResult it returns.
     * detailMatches must ONLY collect SymbolAliases that are new to the node it is
     * being applied to.  Specifically, the MatchResult returned by
     * detailMatches MUST NOT contain any of the aliases contained in the
     * SymbolAliases that was passed in to detailMatches().
     * <p>
     * This is because the caller of detailMatches is responsible for calling
     * detailMatches for all of the source nodes/patterns, and then returning the
     * union of all of they symbols they returned to be used when applying the
     * parent nodes Matchers. If two Matchers each added their source aliases
     * to their results, the caller would see duplicate aliases while computing
     * the union of the returned aliases.
     * <p>
     * Matchers that don't need to validate anything about the internals of a
     * node should return a MatchResult with true and an empty
     * SymbolAliases object from detailMatches and do all of their work in
     * shapeMatches.
     * <p>
     * The plan testing framework should not call a Matcher's detailMatches on a
     * node if shapeMatches didn't return true for the same node.
