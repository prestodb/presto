/**
 * Following JVM argument is needed to run Spark native tests.
 * <p>
 * - PRESTO_SERVER
 * - This tells Spark where to find the Presto native binary to launch the process.
 * Example: -DPRESTO_SERVER=/path/to/native/process/bin
 * <p>
 * - DATA_DIR
 * - Optional path to store TPC-H tables used in the test. If this directory is empty, it will be
 * populated. If tables already exists, they will be reused.
 * <p>
 * Tests can be running in Interactive Debugging Mode that allows for easier debugging
 * experience. Instead of launching its own native process, the test will connect to an existing
 * native process. This gives developers flexibility to connect IDEA and debuggers to the native process.
 * Enable this mode by setting NATIVE_PORT JVM argument.
 * <p>
 * - NATIVE_PORT
 * - This is the port your externally launched native process listens to. It is used to tell Spark where to send
 * requests. This port number has to be the same as to which your externally launched process listens.
 * Example: -DNATIVE_PORT=7777.
 * When NATIVE_PORT is specified, PRESTO_SERVER argument is not requires and is ignored if specified.
 * <p>
 * For test queries requiring shuffle, the disk-based local shuffle will be used.
