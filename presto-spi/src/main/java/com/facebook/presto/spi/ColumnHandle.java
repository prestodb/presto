     * Applies to columns of complex types: arrays, maps and structs. When a query

     * required subfields and the connector is free to prune the rest.
     * <p>
     * Examples:
     *  - SELECT a[1], b['x'], x.y.z FROM t
     *  - SELECT a FROM t WHERE b['y'] > 10
     * <p>
     * Pruning must preserve the type of the values and support unmodified access.
     * <p>
     * - Pruning a struct means populating some of the members with null values.
     * - Pruning a map means dropping keys not listed in the required subfields.
     * - Pruning arrays means dropping values with indices larger than maximum
     * required index and filling in remaining non-required indices with nulls.
