/**
 * A function annotated with &#64;CombineFunction is one that will be used
 * to combine two states into one in aggregation functions.
 * <p>
 * The function should take two arguments. And it should merge both arguments
 * into the first one.
 * <p>
 * The second argument is guaranteed to be the output of
 * {@link AccumulatorStateSerializer#deserialize(Block, int, Object)}.
 * As a result, the implementation of {@code deserialize} method likely
 * provides some application-specific guarantees to the second argument.
