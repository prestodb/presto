 * By default, a function is just a “black box” that the database system knows very little about the behavior of.
 * However, that means that queries using the function may be executed much less efficiently than they could be.
 * It is possible to supply additional knowledge that helps the planner optimize function calls.
 * Scalar functions are straight forward to optimize and can have impact on the overall query performance.
 * Use this annotation to provide information regarding how this function impacts following query statistics.
